# Python Keylogger Project

## Introduction

This project implements a simple keylogger using Python. A keylogger is a program that records every keystroke made by a user. This tool is developed for educational purposes and as a proof of concept for demonstrating how keylogging works in an operating system.

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** This project is intended solely for educational purposes and was used on my own personal computer by me.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes entered by the user.
- Writes the recorded data to a file.
- Runs in the background and is stealthy.
- Works with macOS.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `pynput`: used to listen to the keystrokes and logging the key presses to a .txt file

## Note
MacOS is designed and set up to protect against keyloggers. In order to run the keylogger.py file for educational use,
you may need to bypass the security that's already set up by the OS.
